Pocket PlayLab rails challenge
==============================

This challenge is designed to test one of the most important skills of any
developer: the ability to learn fast and independently.

This repository contains a game backend with several bugs. The tests are
failing, the game developers are complaining, players are giving the games
1-star reviews. It needs to be fixed!

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to clone the repository, fix
the bugs, get the tests to pass, and submit a pull request with your changes.

**Good luck!**
